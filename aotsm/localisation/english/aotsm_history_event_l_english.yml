 history.1.d:0 "A turning point in the history of the Balkans, and the world in general, was the failure of Turkish expansion beyond the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. The weakened and ruined Byzantium managed to outlive its adversary and preserve peace in the Balkans for posterity. \Because of the preservation of the "Crystal Empire", the trade with Asia from Europe was not interrupted and the turnover between the states of the two regions, not only did not decrease, but in many ways it increased. Because of this, the arguments about the need to find a route to India through the West of Columbus crumbled to dust, and Christopher himself to the end of his life in 1514 tried to obtain consent to pay for the expedition, ranging from the Castilian, Aragonese and Portuguese, passing English and French, ending even the Norwegian kings and the Venetian doge. \n\nThe era of great maritime exploration begins in the 20s of the 16th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama attempted to sail Africa from the south and find an alternative route to India. His expedition from Lisbon began in 1519 and already in 1821 he sailed to India and the city of Calicut, returning back to Portugal in 1523 with the evidence of spices. Gama's incredible success was able to inspire many Portuguese navigators to the feat and repeat his journey. In the 20s the first factories on the African coast began to appear, the first of which was the Cape of Good Hope.  \In the years that followed, other major European countries joined the trade and exploration of the lands along the sea route around Africa. Spain with the expeditions of Bartolomé Ferro and Thomas de Berlang, as well as Britain and France with smaller expeditions. Colonization of Africa was pointless, so many factories sprang up on the west, south, and east coasts."

 history.2.d:0 "In 1553 the English mistakenly sailed into the mouth of the Dvina, where Arkhangelsk now stands, where they were welcomed and afterwards received by the tsar of Russia. In 1554 the Russo-English trade treaties were concluded, and in 1555 the Moscow Company was founded, Russia became an important trade ally for England, as did England for Moscow. \In the 16th century Europe entered the 16th century with a festering religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics, which ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, which confirmed the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire and equalized Catholics and Protestants. \Intensive expeditions by the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean led in 1542 to Japan, and in 1580 to trade with the Shoguns of Japan. In 1600 active trade with China began and the total flow of goods from China and Japan across the Indian Ocean around Africa was known as the "Maritime Silk Road. \The English Revolution began in 1640 and ended in 1653 with the establishment of Cromwell's protectorate. In fact, a dictatorship was established which brought order to the country and subjugated Scotland and Ireland, thereby forming the Confederation of the British Isles. \Further colonization in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries allowed navigators to discover and establish a colony in Hawaii in 1762, and the east coast of Cromwell and later the Amazon in 1787. From this point onward, active exploration of the lands of the "New World" began".

 history.3.t:0 "History of Prussia
 history.3.d:0 "Having emerged victorious from the war of the '3rd Coalition,' Prussia did not long rest on its laurels. After all, by 1840 the tension in the German region began to grow rapidly, so both Prussian and Austrian forces immediately tried to subdue one or another region./But after 2 years it was clear that neither country could achieve serious superiority, because the revolutionary forces were much more organized than the government. The result of these events was the revolution of 1848, when the German Empire was "formed," but the invasion of southern Germany by Austria made it impossible to create a unified state. The King of Prussia, now Emperor of all Germany, constantly demanded that Austria withdraw its troops, but each such attempt was ignored.nBut by 1849 Prussian patience was at an end and preparations for military action against Austria began."

 history.4.t:0 "History of Romea"
 history.4.d:0 ""Our history almost came to an end in §G1341§! year, when a civil war struck our weakened empire, but the appearance of a Jewish military commander of the Zacharias dynasty, who gathered military and political leaders around him in the shortest possible time, was able to end the civil war in less than a year. Because of the rapidity of the event, the internal destruction was reduced to a minimum, but the dynasty changed again and now Zacharias sat as the new emperor, the new hope. \In his reign the empire began its consolidation, and the intelligent mind of the new emperor made it possible to minimize the effects of the §G1347§!-§G1348§! plague. Likewise, by §G1351§! the Greeks had finally concentrated on their main enemy, the Ottomans. Which also made it possible to protect Europe from the Ottoman invasion, for in §G1352§! they were never able to gain a foothold in Europe. After defeating the Ottoman invasion an agreement was made between the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, the result of which was support in exchange for giving up influence in the Balkans, except for the territory of Greece. \This support allowed Romea to speed up the process of consolidation and recovery from all past crises. In §G1391§! the emperor dies, so that the course changes from fortification to the return of lost lands. By the beginning of the §GXV§! century the process of regaining the Greek lands began, a process that took a long time, but was extremely successful. But by §G1434§! year Romea had already received a warning from the Holy See because of an attempted invasion of Bulgaria, which put an end to expansion in the Balkans. By the beginning of §G1457§! the slow return of the Asiatic lands began. Also in this century was finally spoiled Romeo-Russian relations, because Muscovy declared itself the protector of all the Orthodox lands. Because of this, both Moscow and Constantinople began the process of reformation of the church. \n§GXVI! century also became the renaissance of Greek culture. In the same way, throughout the century Romea sought to strengthen relations with the Papal See, and talk of overcoming the Schism began. During these same years the world was full of Romanesque scholars and artists, which again made the Roman Empire the center of European culture. The \n§GXVII! century again nearly cut short the history of the empire. In the early years, there was a successful §R attempt on the Emperor! which interrupted the main branch of the dynasty. Andronicus V, brother of the late emperor, became the new emperor. His reign is remembered for the harsh suppression of rebellion and insurrection, as well as for the advance of the empire's territories in the Caucasus. \The 18th century was the age of enlightenment, when schools and universities began to be built throughout the empire. The emperors of this period sought to provide access to knowledge and culture for ordinary citizens. Also by the end of the century, the lands of Mesopotamia, Judea, and the Coptic revolution in Egypt were conquered. \The 19th century began with the Napoleonic Wars and the construction of the Byzantine Canal. These events showed the military backwardness of the Romish army from the European countries, which led to the strengthening of the Romano-Prussian relations. By 1849 the state of the Empire was extremely good, which left Emperor Augustus II with the choice of consolidating §0his power! finally, or stepping down and transferring the power to the §Vsensate!".

 history.5.t:0 "History of France"
 history.5.d:0 "Prussia's entry into the war of the '3rd Coalition' predetermined the defeat of France. Defeated at Austerlitz, the French army was forced to retreat, and subsequent battles were just as unsuccessful for Napoleon.  The general collapse of the army's morale and the subsequent coup of the military junta only exacerbated the situation and in the fall of 1805 the war was already raging on French soil. \The war ended badly for the French. Having overthrown the military, the socialist government was forced to sign the humiliating "Peace of Rheims. After losing Alsace and Lorraine and paying huge reparations, France had to deal with the post-war devastation. \It took a long time to rebuild the country's economy. By 1816, however, the economy had largely recovered. The extraordinary powers of the government, extended all these years, came to an end. On November 9, 1816, Jacques René Hébert announced his resignation. \Cyrille Lepage was the first elected head of government. As a candidate of the left-wing liberal party, he won 51.6% of the votes, leaving his rivals no chance to win. Under him, France continued its economic expansion and, for the first time in a long time, began to conduct an independent foreign policy. \In the 1930s, the country began a rapid growth of production. The country's economy, which had caught up with pre-war figures a few years before, received a sharp acceleration, thanks to trade and in particular the "Faubert Agreement" concluded with a number of countries. It even saved the country from an overproduction crisis later on. \At the time of 1849, the country was going through a political crisis. The struggle in the last elections between Charles Lagrange and Louis Napoleon resulted in the defeat of the latter. This set a number of precedents that showed the resolute attitude of the militarists. The contradictions between the new head of government and reactionary circles, created a general instability in the country, dividing the French people..."

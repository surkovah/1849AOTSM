They naturally speak out about his removal from power and the transition to a republic with the preservation of the titular empire. The Imperial faction, in turn, speaks extremely negatively about this idea, the General Faction remained neutral until today's meeting, where restrictions on the power of the military were also added to the emperor's restriction, which is why they entered into a coalition with the Imperial Faction. The majority of the Senate is still behind the coalition of democratic forces, but due to the gap of only 5 seats, his Imperial Majesty is given the words and he decides... "

And you're asking me to resign in such stressful times? My father told me how our country suffered during the "War of the Third Coalition", how our soldiers died for OUR ideals, for OUR future. And now, when the world is getting more tense in Europe every day, do you want me to just leave?"  The emperor spoke slowly and thoughtfully. \n\n —"We demand only freedom and justice for all. We are a European country and we must develop like everyone else." — the head of the People's Faction Alexandros Mavrokordatos spoke proudly. \n\n —"But don't hard times require a strong hand that will lead the people to victory? Today I speak not as your emperor, but as your compatriot. I want OUR empire to succeed, not fall, as it once could. If the Great Zacharias had been gentle, could he then have defeated Osman on Galipoli? No! And you're talking about freedom and justice? So look at Russia, has anything changed there with the departure of the monarch? No, living conditions are getting harder every year. And France, overthrew the monarch and launched into a bloody massacre in Europe, do you really want such freedom and justice? I don't think so." — now the emperor spoke with obvious pride for the past of his country. \n\n —"But if we allow your tyranny, will anyone feel good?"  Alexandros interrupted the emperor. \n\n —"I swear to every citizen of our state I will not be a tyrant! I will become someone our people will be proud of. I swear that our empire will be able to achieve the successes of Justinian I again. I also swear that by 1854 I will begin to implement the first reforms that will allow, as you say, "to give freedom" to OUR citizens."  After these words, the emperor returned the crown to his head and took his place. \n\n It was only after the emperor sat down that the entire Imperial and General Faction gave themselves up in applause, but what is even more strange, even several members of the People's and Trade Faction also began to applaud. Which led to..."
